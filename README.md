## Description

Challenge yourself as you race against the clock to type the randomly displayed words as quickly as you possibly can. For each accurate word that you type, a new word will appear and additional time will be added to the clock.

Accumulate points for each accurately typed word, but don't let the time run out or it'll be game over. Speed Typer is a fun and exciting way to practice your typing skills that will have you hooked.

Speed Typer generates random words from the [Random Words API](https://github.com/mcnaveen/Random-Words-API) and places it in the DOM. The application has a settings toggle that not only allows the player to toggle between difficulties, but stores difficulty setting in local storage.
