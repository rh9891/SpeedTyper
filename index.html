                <h1>How to Play</h1>
                <p>Challenge yourself as you race against the clock to type the randomly displayed words as quickly as you possibly can. For each accurate word that you type, a new word will appear and additional time will be added to the clock.</p>
                
                <p>Accumulate points for each accurately typed word, but don't let the time run out or it'll be game over. It's a fun and exciting way to practice your typing skills that will have you hooked.</p>
